<!-- 
    copy wpkg logfile to \\servername\wpkgreports\ for further processing
    execute at 0 priority so it executes last
    
    assumptions/notes:
    1. wpkg logfile is at root of %systemdrive%
    2. logfiles are copied to \\servername\wpkgreports
    3. the user running wpkg has write access to this folder.
       this may be accomplished by enabling guest write access to the folder (easy on Samba 3, less so on real current AD)
       or by supplying credentials to wpkg to connect to the server with.
    4. because we're copying the log file to a server, do this only for machines on site, not remote machines.
    
    18/04/14  dce   version based on http://www.pretentiousname.com/timesync/
    23/03/15  dce   move reports to wpkgreports
    25/03/15  dce   add not very well documented notify="false" so we can turn on notification in general
                    derive server name from %SOFTWARE%
    14/08/15  dce   use %comspec% /c cscript to run vbs file, so we can do the SET variable manipulation
    03/08/15  dce   small tweak to wpkgreports path generation
    21/05/18  dce   use wpkguserdetails.vbs
